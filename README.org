* cm-incudine
** Overview
   /cm-incudine/ extends common music 2 (the common lisp port of
   common music) with realtime capabilities using the [[http://incudine.sourceforge.net/][incudine]]
   realtime system by Tito Latini. Currently realtime MIDI, FUDI, OSC
   and any function call are supported. Note: [[http://incudine.sourceforge.net/][incudine]] currently only
   works with [[http://www.sbcl.org/][sbcl]] and a working [[http://jackaudio.org/][JACK]] setup.

   The Common Lisp package depends on

   - [[http://incudine.sourceforge.net/][incudine]]
   - [[https://github.com/ormf/fudi-incudine][fudi-incudine]]
   - [[https://github.com/ormf/cm][cm]]
   - [[https://github.com/ormf/cm-incudine][cm-incudine]]

   As all the code is evaluated within the =:cm= package and exported
   from there, code evaluation should take place within the =:cm=
   package as well.

   Realtime processes can be invoked by either using the =events=
   function with an incudine-stream or =*rts-out*= as second argument
   or the =sprout= function. The processes now also support realtime
   FUDI messages in addition to OSC and MIDI messages.

** Installation

   You need a system with a working [[http://jackaudio.org/][JACK]] and [[http://www.sbcl.org/][sbcl]] setup.

   First get all Common Lisp components:

   - [[http://incudine.sourceforge.net/][incudine]]
   - [[https://github.com/ormf/fudi-incudine][fudi-incudine]]
   - [[https://github.com/ormf/cm][cm]]
   - [[https://github.com/ormf/cm-incudine][cm-incudine]]

   Using a common lisp with quicklisp installed, copy all the folders
   of the prerequsites into the local-projects subfolder of your local
   quicklisp installation folder (default is
   <home>/quicklisp/local-projects).

** Usage

   First start [[http://jackaudio.org/][JACK]], then sbcl and evaluate the following:

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (ql:quickload "cm-incudine")

     (cm:rts)
   #+END_SRC

   The last command automatically changes into the =:cm= package,
   starts the incudine realtime thread, adds audio ports and MIDI
   ports to jack.

*** MIDI Output

   To send realtime MIDI messages to jackmidi output you can use
   =output=, =events= or =sprout=. Before testing the following code
   make sure some MIDI synth (e.g. [[https://qsynth.sourceforge.io/][QSynth]]) is started and connected to
   the incudine midi-out port (e.g. using the [[https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io/][QjackCtl]] program).

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (output (new midi))

     (events
      (loop for x below 10
         collect (new midi :time (* x 0.5) :keynum (between 60 71)))
      ,*rts-out*)

     (sprout
      (loop for x below 10
         collect (new midi :time (* x 0.5) :keynum (between 60 71))))

     (events
      (process
        repeat 5
        output (new midi :time (now) :keynum (between 60 71))
        wait 0.5)
      ,*rts-out*)

     (sprout
      (process
        repeat 5
        output (new midi :time (now) :keynum (between 60 71))
        wait 0.5))
   #+END_SRC




*** FUDI output and input
    
    Sending to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data][Pure Data]] requires to first start pd and open or create
    a patch containing a =[netreceive 3012]= object. For testing
    purposes a =[print]= object connected to the netreceive's left
    outlet can be used. In this case watch the messages appearing in
    pd's post window, when sending FUDI messages from cm to pd using
    the code below.

    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
      (fudi-open-default :host "127.0.0.1" :port 3012 :direction :output)

      (sprout
       (process
         repeat 2
         output (new fudi :time (now) :message '(1 2 3 4))
         wait 1))

    #+END_SRC

    Receiving FUDI also works after opening the respective stream with 

    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (fudi-open-default :host "127.0.0.1" :port 3011 :direction :input)
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : #<FUDI:INPUT-STREAM :TCP "127.0.0.1" 3011>

    Please refer to the common music docs for handling input events
    and establishing receivers.

*** OSC output and input

    Sending OSC messages is similar to sending FUDI messages except
    that OSC requires argument type information in addition to the
    message itself.

    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (osc-open-default :host "127.0.0.1" :port 3003 :direction :output)

     (sprout
      (process
        repeat 2
        output (new osc :time (now) :types "iiii" :message '(1 2 3 4))
        wait 1))
    #+END_SRC

    receiving OSC also works after opening the respective stream with 

    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (osc-open-default :host "127.0.0.1" :port 3004 :direction :input)
    #+END_SRC

    Please refer to the common music docs for handling input events
    and establishing receivers.

*** Miscellaneous

    The default time format is :sec but can also be set to :sample or :ms
    with the function =set-time-format=.

    The functions =at= and =now= are wrappers for the same incudine
    functions which automatically translate from/to the current
    time-format.

    For other usage examples see the file =src/cm-incudine-examples.lisp=.
