* Clamps Documentation
  The complete HTML documentation is contained in
  "clamps/doc/clamps-doc.tgz". Unpacking the archive will result in a
  folder called "clamps-doc" which contains the subfolders of the 5
  parts of the documentation and the file index.html, which can be
  opened with a Webbrowser.
