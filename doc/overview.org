* Introduction
** What is Clamps?
  # #+TOC: headlines 3
  Clamps, the /*C*​ommon *L*​isp *A*​ided *M*​usic *P*​roduction *S*​ystem/
  is an integrated environment for the production of music in the
  areas of algorithmic composition, electronic music and its
  performance. It can be used for non-realtime production of
  instrumental scores or fixed media, as a toolbox for music
  simulation or as a development environment in a broad field of
  applications like advanced DSP, realtime instruments, performances
  and installative work.

  In this regard it is comparable to other realtime and non-realtime
  music programming environments like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Data][Pure Data]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_(software)][Max/MSP]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csound][Csound]],
  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider][SuperCollider]], [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/clm/][CLM]], [[https://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/][Common Music]], [[https://chuck.stanford.edu/][Chuck]], [[https://faust.grame.fr/][Faust]], [[https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/openmusic/][Open Music]],
  [[https://opusmodus.com/][OpusModus]], [[https://michael-edwards.org/sc/][Slippery Chicken]] and [[https://www.music21.org/music21docs/][Music21]].

  Clamps is a collection of tools, developed over the course of some
  decades primarily for the artistic work of its author, biased by his
  conceptual and aesthetic ideas. It is put together and made public
  in the hope it might be useful for others, but -like one of the
  integral characteristics of the beauty of Art in general- without
  any explict or implicit warranty that it fits any purpose
  whatsoever.
  
  The Documentation of Clamps is split into four parts, accessible
  using the Top Menu:

  - The [[Introduction][Overview]] explains the raison d'etre of Clamps and gives a
    short overview of its components, followed by installation
    instructions, a short primer and an introduction into tools
    available when working with Common Lisp in Emacs.

    
  - The [[../clamps/index.html][Clamps Packages]] section gives a more detailed introduction
    with examples into the [[Internal components of Clamps][internal components]] specifically written
    for Clamps. The [[External Components of Clamps][external components]] which make up a large part of
    the functionality of Clamps, are not documented here as they are
    well documented in their own respective documention available
    online.

    
  - The [[../cm-dict/index.html][CM Dictionary]] is part of the Common Lisp version of Common
    Music and is integrated into the Emacs/Lisp interface with online
    symbol lookup using the /<C-c C-d c>/ keyboard shortcut on any of
    its entries. It is included here because Clamps extends the symbol
    lookup with the symbols added by Clamps in the [[../clamps-dict/index.html][Clamps Dictionary]],
    providing a seemless integration.

    
  - The [[../clamps-dict/index.html][Clamps Dictionary]] is inspired by and extends the [[../cm-dict/index.html][CM Dictionary]]
    with the added symbols of Clamps. The entries of this dictionary
    are linked in the Emacs Lisp Interface with the same /<C-c C-d c>/
    keyboard shortcut as the CM Dictionary.

#+LATEX: NOTE

  This documentation serves as a reference manual for the regular user
  and not as a step by step introduction or tutorial into the
  system. These topics are or will be covered in seperate
  publications. Knowledge of Common Lisp, the Emacs Editor and the
  basics of Common Music, Incudine or GUI programming are required to
  take full advantage of this documentation.

  Clamps would not have been possible without the tremendous work put
  into Incudine by Tito Latini, Common Music by Rick Taube, FOMUS by
  David Psenicka, CLOG by David Botton, ATS by Juan Pampin and of
  course Common Lisp by innumerable people, who helped building this
  amazing programming language with all its extensions over the last
  65+ years. Making all their work available to the public using an
  open source license provides the basis for being able to extend
  it. It can't be expressed enough how grateful and privileged I feel
  having been able to use the results of their work and benefit from
  them throughout my artistic career. In that sense making Clamps
  available to the public is my contribution intended to pay back to
  the community.

  Orm Finnendahl, August 2025
** Why Clamps?
  
   Clamps is written in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp][Common Lisp]]. A main advantage of using Common
   Lisp is the integrated immediate accessibility of the source code
   of Clamps, its [[External Components of Clamps][External Components]] and the Common Lisp language
   itself down to the lowest implementation level while working with
   it. Changes to every detail can easily be done on-the-fly, even
   while realtime DSP routines are running, resulting in an immediate
   acoustical feedback of the changes.

   This is in contrast to most systems used for realtime processing
   mentioned in the [[Introduction][Introduction]]. Many of them use precompiled objects
   for low level processing tasks written in a language different from
   the language/paradigm of the system itself[fn:1]. These systems
   suppose that changes in those modules are generally not done by the
   user and rare. They require a seperate development process using
   editors/compilers different from the used system and require a
   restart of the system on every change.

   In addition, some systems use a distinction between control-rate
   and audio-rate processing or between a language and a synth server
   like SuperCollider. All these design decisions are there for a
   reason and have their advantages, but they put obstacles and
   barriers in the way which can create manyfold problems when working
   with them. In Clamps, all DSP routines, the scheduler and the
   control engine run as functions or macros within the same Lisp
   image. Therefore the aforementioned barriers are not present when
   using the system, resulting in a seemless experience of
   transparency on every level of the working process. Although it
   might rarely be necessary to tinker with the lowest level of the
   system, it is nevertheless possible at any moment of working with
   it. Any change is at the fingertips of the user, just a few
   keystrokes away, providing the unique experience typical for most
   Lisp based systems.

   In recent decades the Common Lisp ecosystem has evolved
   significantly providing fast compilers and outstanding [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment][IDEs]] for
   code inspection, editing and debugging. In combiniation with the
   language's unique and characteristic features like the ease of
   combining different idioms from low level to high level using any
   programming paradigm and its flexibility to adapt its syntax to any
   problem domain make it an excellent choice for people aiming for an
   explorative and dynamic workflow in their artistic work.
** External components of Clamps

   As the acronym as a word implies, /Clamps/ combines and extends
   different Common Lisp Packages. Apart from using many general
   purpose Lisp packages, crucial components of Clamps are realized on
   top of the following packages which do the heavy lifting of Clamps'
   functionality:

   - [[Incudine][Incudine]]
     
   - [[Common Music][Common Music]]

   - [[FOMUS][FOMUS]]

   - [[ATS][ATS]]
     
   - [[CLOG][CLOG]]

   These systems and their contribution to Clamps are described in the
   following subsections.
*** Incudine

    [[https://incudine.sourceforge.net/][Incudine]] is the backbone of the system for everything related to
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing][Real-time computing]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing][DSP]]. It is actively developed and
    maintained at the time of writing this manual by Tito Latini and
    released under an open source license. Incudine is a very
    efficient DSP engine with a builtin sample accurate scheduler,
    combining many ideas from other well established systems like
    [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csound][Csound]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider][SuperCollider]] or [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/clm/][CLM]]. Incudine has no preconceptions
    concerning audio- or control-rate. It can be used with any
    blocksize starting from 1 sample.
*** Common Music
    [[https://commonmusic.sourceforge.net/][Common Music]] (also called /CM/) is another crucial component of
    Clamps. It has been developed since the early 1990s by Rick Taube
    and is released with an open source license. Common Music was
    primarily conceived to facilitate algorithmic composition on the
    Metalevel[fn:2]. Initially written in Common Lisp, it has since
    been transformed into version 3 using the Scheme programming
    language, adding sophisticated realtime capabilities likening it
    to the purpose of Clamps. The system used in Clamps is based on
    the last Common Lisp version 2.12, released around
    2008/2009. Although this version already contained realtime
    capablilities, this functionality has been adapted in Clamps using
    [[Incudine][Incudine]]. Clamps extends the functionality of CM by adding classes
    for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG][SVG]] import/export as well as [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SFZ_(file_format)][SFZ]] and sample based in-/output
    realized using [[Incudine][Incudine]].
*** FOMUS
    [[https://fomus.sourceforge.net/][FOMUS]] is a system for score output originally developed in Common
    Lisp around 2010/2011 by David Psenicka. It integrates well with
    Common Music, facilitating output in a wide range of backend
    formats like [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Music_Notation][CMN]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LilyPond][LilyPond]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MusicXML][MusicXML]]. In Clamps, mainly the
    LilyPond backend is supported.
*** ATS
    [[https://github.com/ormf/cl-ats][ATS]] was originally developed by Juan Pampin in the early 2000s
    using Common Lisp for the analysis, transformation and
    (re)synthesis of audio files using FFT based algorithms similar to
    [[https://www.klingbeil.com/spear/][SPEAR]]. It predates SPEAR by nearly a decade and has been published
    with an open source license making it eligible for integration
    into Clamps. In addition to the analysis of sinusoidal components
    performed by SPEAR it also captures and synthesizes the residual
    noise component of the analyzed audio files. For Clamps the
    synthesis engine has been completely rewritten in [[Incudine][Incudine]].

*** CLOG
    [[https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog][CLOG]] is a web based system written by David Botton in Common Lisp
    and Javascript to enable the rendering of Graphical User
    Interfaces in a Webbrowser using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket][Websockets]] for the communication
    between Common Lisp and the Browser. CLOG closes the gap of
    missing GUIs in Common Lisp based systems due to the time of the
    definition of the Common Lisp Standard in the 1980s, predating the
    predominant use of GUIS in current computer applications.
** Internal Components of Clamps
   Based on the [[External Components of Clamps][External Components of Clamps]] many additional packages
   were developed. They extend the functionality of the external
   components, aiming at integration in some unified way without
   compromising any of their original functionality and usability.

   - [[Incudine extensions][Incudine extensions]]

   - [[Common Music extensions][Common Music extensions]]

   - [[CLOG extensions][CLOG extensions]]

   - [[ATS extensions][ATS extensions]]
*** Incudine extensions
    - /of-incudine-dsps/

      This package contains DSPs for /buffer/ playback/recording
      and /sample/ playback with granular stretching/transposing, an
      infrastructure for /audio buses/ capable to deal with any
      blocksize, /bus DSPs/ for any number of channels, various
      /levelmeter DSPs/, some basic /Unit Generators/ (VUGs) adapted
      to work with a blocksize > 1 and miscellaneous basic /envelopes/
      and /function tables/.

    - /incudine-bufs/

      This package implements an infrastructure dealing with loading,
      registering and finding buffers. It ensures that buffers are
      unique and not inadvertedly loaded repeatedly to keep the memory
      footprint low. In addition a search mechanism is implemented to
      look for files in user definable paths.
*** Common Music extensions
    - /cm-incudine/

      Compatibility layer to bind the original MIDI, OSC and real-time
      scheduling related functions of CM 2 to their equivalent in
      Incudine.
      
    - /cm-fomus/

      This is not a package in its own right but rather a thin wrapper
      to integrate [[https://fomus.sourceforge.net/][FOMUS]] into cm. Most parts were written by Rick
      Taube for CM 2 and got adapted to Clamps.
    
    - /cm-poolevt/

      Eventclass and infrastructure for sample-based granular
      playback.
    
    - /cm-poolplayer/

      Infrastructure for Live-Coding based players of sample events.
    
    - /cm-sfz/

      Eventclass and infrastructure for SFZ based realtime playback
      using incudine. Also implements a path based search
      infrastructure for SFZ definitions.

    - /cm-svg/

      Infrastructure to import and export CM events to and from SVG
      files.

    - /cm-utils/

      Package defining a generalized process mechanism called
      /rt-proc/, based on coroutines, allowing arbitrary lisp
      iteration contructs and multiple waits in its body and
      miscellaneous utility functions.
*** CLOG extensions
    - /clog-dsp-widgets/

      Implementation of various GUI elements for realtime interactive
      work or display, like Sliders, Number Boxes, Buttons, Toggles,
      Radiobuttons, VU-Meters, Scopes, etc. in a browser including a
      sophisticated infrastructure for connecting the state of Common
      Lisp objects with the GUI parts that were written in JavaScript
      to do client side rendering. The package not only facilitates
      the creation of sophisticated GUIs nowadays taken for granted in
      computer music environments, but allows for collaborative
      performances with multiple synced GUIs using standard hardware
      like Mobile phones or Tablets without the need to install
      specialized programs.

    - /ats-cuda-display/

      A Gui to interactively explore and play Sounds analyzed with
      ATS.

    - /cm-svg.rts/

      GUI for the interactive display and playback of SVG files
      exported from CM.    
*** ATS extensions
    - /ats-cuda/

      This package implements the DSPs for resynthesizing ATS analysis
      data in realtime.
*** Miscellaneous
    - /cuda-usocket-osc/
      
      A small compatibility layer to make OSC work on OSX.

    - /cl-plot/

      Plotting extension using [[http://www.gnuplot.info/][gnuplot]].
    
    - /cl-sfz/

      Base package to parse and load sfz files into incudine.
    
    - /orm-utils/

      A collection of Common Lisp utility functions.

* Tools
** Context Help
    For every compiled expression[fn:3], the /sly-mode/ in Emacs takes
    care of automatically storing all information of the expression
    internally. In case of functions this means that the signature of
    any compiled function is known and will be displayed in the
    Minibuffer of Emacs when typing the name of a function in an
    inferior lisp buffer[fn:4]:

    #+attr_html: :width 80%
    #+CAPTION: Context help of function arguments in the Minibuffer
    [[file:../img/function-help.png]]
** Finding Source Definitions
    To jump to the source definition of any compiled expression, use
    the <C-.> key. This will jump to definitions in other files,
    opening them if necessary. To get back to the place before the
    jump, press the /<C-,>/ key. This is recursive: Repeated jumps to
    source locations with /<C-.>/ can be reversed one by one with the
    same number of /<C-,>/.
** Code Inspection
   Sly comes with a powerful and versatile code inspector. It can be
   invoked by pressing the /<C-c I>/ key sequence after an expression
   to be inspected. The expression will be prompted in the Emacs
   Minibuffer and needs to be confirmed with the /<Enter>/ key. A new
   buffer will open with information about the inspected
   expression.
   
    #+attr_html: :width 80%
    #+CAPTION: The Sly Inspector invoked on (make-instance 'sfz)
    [[file:../img/sly-inspector.png]]
   
   Depending on the type of expression it is possible to navigate to
   subsequences of inspected sequences, see and inspect the slots of
   structures or classes and their value, modify/unbind them, unbind
   symbols and much more[fn:5]. It is very important to get acquainted
   and comfortable using the inspector right from the start of working
   with Clamps as it provides invaluable information about the current
   state of a Lisp session.
   
   The buffer of the inspector can be closed with the /<q>/ key.

Composition]].

[fn:3] Compiling an expression in Sly means to move the cursor
somewhere into or just behind an expression or form to be compiled and
then press /<C-c C-c>/. This will compile the toplevel form of the
expression.

[fn:4] For this to work, the /company/ minor-mode has to be active in
the lisp buffer. The standard [[Installation][installation]] should take care of that.
